This is an application for generating Sudoku puzzles. In the future, It is planned to make a generic board that can generate, 4x4, 9x9 and 16x16 sudokus. As well as solving them from websites online. This is not a cheating application, it was meant to be a challenge. Proving it works with websites just proves my bruteforce method is successful, not efficient.

One of my weakest areas in programming, number theory and set theory as well as discrete math problem solving such as this, I overcame this problem with a bruteforce solution. This is one of my favorite at the time of this writing because of the level of satisfaction I feel from being able to successfulyl complete this challenge I posed to myself a while ago.
